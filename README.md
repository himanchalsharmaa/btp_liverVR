# btp_liverVR

Used MRTK,Unity and OculusSDK to create a VR experience to visualize the impact of liver function test (LFT) results on a 3D liver model. Users can manipulate the model and observe changes based on slider values. Inflating components and changing color patches represent the effects of specific parameter ranges. By selectively coloring triangles within a sphere collider, scarring in a particular region is depicted. This immersive VR environment provides valuable insights into the implications of LFT results on liver health.
